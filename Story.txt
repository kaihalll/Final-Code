Narrative: 


You wake up in a place that does not seem like your house. It is very eerie and dusty, it seems like it is abandoned. You come to a realization that you have been kidnapped, how are you supposed to escape? You feel very dizzy and look around, everything is blurry. However, you see there are four different colored doors in the room. One is Red, one is Blue, one is Yellow, one is Green, all with door handles. There is another door that looks different. It looks very grand compared to the others doors, and has different animals on the door. You believe that might be the exit, and do not see anyone so try to turn the handle and up getting shocked. Ouch!


Reeling from the shock, you take a moment to steady yourself, the sharp pain slowly subsiding. You realize that simply attempting to escape without understanding the rules of this place might not be the best approach. With your vision gradually clearing and the initial dizziness wearing off, you begin to survey your surroundings more carefully.
The room is dimly lit, with only a faint light filtering in from a small, grimy window near the ceiling. Cobwebs hang from the corners, and a thick layer of dust covers the floor, undisturbed except for your own recent movements. The four brightly colored doors stand in stark contrast to the otherwise monochrome and derelict room. Each door is solid, with no keyholes, suggesting they may open only under specific conditions or might be traps themselves.


With these observations, you weigh your options. The grand door with the animal engravings, now known to be electrified, could indeed be the exit, but clearly, it requires a safer approach or some means to deactivate the shock mechanism.


In the center of the room, you find a small, round table with a dusty old book opened on it. As you flip through the pages, it reveals hints and riddles corresponding to the colors and symbols of the doors. The book suggests that choosing the correct door based on the understanding of these symbols is key to unlocking the grand exit door safely. It reads, "The path to freedom lies not in haste but in wisdom."


You decide to explore the clues linked with each colored door, understanding that solving the riddle of this bizarre trap is the only way to escape.
